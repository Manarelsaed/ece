        <p>Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting
            software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.

            For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an
            intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,
            hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are
            found on many devices that contain a computer â€“ from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers
            and supercomputers.
            <br>
            The dominant general-purpose[3] desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around
            76.45%. macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place (17.72%), and the varieties of Linux are collectively in
            third place (1.73%).[4] In the mobile sector (including smartphones and tablets), Android's share is up to
            72% in the year 2020
            According to third quarter 2016 data, Android's share on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent with also
            a growth rate of 10.3 percent per year, followed by Apple's iOS with 12.1 percent with per year decrease in
            market share of 5.2 percent, while other
            operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent.[6] Linux distributions are dominant in the server and
            supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes of operating systems (special-purpose operating
            systems)[3][7]), such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications. Security-focused
            operating systems also exist. Some operating systems have low system requirements (e.g. light-weight Linux
            distribution). Others may have higher system requirements.
            Some operating systems require installation or may come pre-installed with purchased computers
            (OEM-installation), whereas others may run directly from media (i.e. live cd) or flash memory

    <div class="Modes">
        <p>
            Modern microprocessors (CPU or MPU) support multiple modes of operation. CPUs with this capability offer at
            least two modes: user mode and supervisor mode. In general terms, supervisor mode operation allows
            unrestricted access to all machine resources, including all MPU instructions. <br>
            instruction use and typically disallows direct access to machine resources. CPUs might have other modes
            similar to user mode as well, such as the virtual modes in order to emulate older processor types, such as
            16-bit processors on a 32-bit one, or 32-bit processors on a 64-bit one.<br>
            At power-on or reset, the system begins in supervisor mode. Once an operating system kernel has been loaded
            and started, the boundary between user mode and supervisor mode (also known as kernel mode) can be
            established.<br>
            Supervisor mode is used by the kernel for low level tasks that need unrestricted access to hardware, such as
            controlling how memory is accessed, and communicating with devices such as disk drives and video display
            devices. User mode, in contrast, is used for almost everything else. Application programs, such as word
            processors and database managers,<br>
            operate within user mode, and can only access machine resources by turning control over to the kernel, a
            process which causes a switch to supervisor mode. Typically, the transfer of control to the kernel is
            achieved by executing a software interrupt instruction, such as the Motorola 68000 TRAP instruction.<br>
            The software interrupt causes the microprocessor to switch from user mode to supervisor mode and begin
            executing code that allows the kernel to take control.<br>
            In user mode, programs usually have access to a restricted set of microprocessor instructions, and generally
            cannot execute any instructions that could potentially cause disruption to the system's operation. In
            supervisor mode, instruction execution restrictions are typically removed, allowing the kernel unrestricted
            access to all machine resources.<br>
            The term "user mode resource" generally refers to one or more CPU registers, which contain information that
            the running program isn't allowed to alter. Attempts to alter these resources generally causes a switch to
            supervisor mode, where the operating system can deal with the illegal operation the program was attempting,
            for example, by forcibly terminating ("killing") the program).<br>

            Unix was originally written in assembly language.[15] Ken Thompson wrote B, mainly based on BCPL, based on
            his experience in the MULTICS project. B was replaced by C, and Unix, rewritten in C, developed into a
            large, complex family of inter-related operating systems which have been influential in every modern
            operating system
            The Unix-like family is a diverse group of operating systems, with several major sub-categories including
            System V, BSD, and Linux. The name "UNIX" is a trademark of The Open Group which licenses it for use with
            any operating system that has been shown to conform to their definitions.
            "UNIX-like" is commonly used to refer to the large set of operating systems which resemble the original
            UNIX.
            Unix-like systems run on a wide variety of computer architectures. They are used heavily for servers in
            business, as well as workstations in academic and engineering environments.
            Four operating systems are certified by The Open Group (holder of the Unix trademark) as Unix. HP's HP-UX
            and IBM's AIX are both descendants of the original System V Unix and are designed to run only on their
            respective vendor's hardware. In contrast, Sun Microsystems's Solaris can run on multiple types of hardware,
            including x86 and Sparc servers, and PCs. Apple's macOS, a replacement for Apple's earlier (non-Unix) Mac
            OS, is a hybrid kernel-based BSD variant derived from NeXTSTEP, Mach, and FreeBSD.
            Unix interoperability was sought by establishing the POSIX standard. The POSIX standard can be applied to
            any operating system, although it was originally created for various Unix variants.

    <div class="BSD">
        <p>
            A subgroup of the Unix family is the Berkeley Software Distribution family, which includes FreeBSD, NetBSD,
            and OpenBSD. These operating systems are most commonly found on webservers, although they can also function
            as a personal computer OS.<br>
            The Internet owes much of its existence to BSD, as many of the protocols now commonly used by computers to
            connect, send and receive data over a network were widely implemented and refined in BSD. The World Wide Web
            was also first demonstrated on a number of computers running an OS based on BSD called NeXTSTEP.<br>
            In 1974, University of California, Berkeley installed its first Unix system. Over time, students and staff
            in the computer science department there began adding new programs to make things easier, such as text
            editors. <br>
            received new VAX computers in 1978 with Unix installed, the school's undergraduates modified Unix even more
            in order to take advantage of the computer's hardware possibilities. The Defense Advanced Research Projects
            Agency of the US Department of Defense took interest, and decided to fund the project. Many schools,
            corporations, and government organizations took notice and started to use Berkeley's version of Unix instead
            of the official one distributed by AT&T.<br>
            Steve Jobs, upon leaving Apple Inc. in 1985, formed NeXT Inc., a company that manufactured high-end
            computers running on a variation of BSD called NeXTSTEP. One of these computers was used by Tim Berners-Lee
            as the first webserver to create the World Wide Web.<br>
            Developers like Keith Bostic encouraged the project to replace any non-free code that originated with Bell
            Labs. Once this was done, however, AT&T sued. After two years of legal disputes, the BSD project spawned a
            number of free derivatives, such as NetBSD and FreeBSD (both in 1993), and OpenBSD (from NetBSD in
            1995.<br>
